ROOT

The root folder defines the entrypoint for whatever storage medium might be serving it.

Usually people use an external drive, a network share exposed by a NAS or even bigger things like cluster shares.

The root defines several main sections. These main sections allow for an easy seperation of content and should stay within a certain cognitive complexity.
